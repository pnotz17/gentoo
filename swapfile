### SWAPFILE

1. Create a file called, for example, /swapfile of a needed size (if this example 1M means 1 million blocks, which will give you a 512MB file):
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=8200M	

2. Use mkswap to get your file ready for swaping:
mkswap /swapfile	
chmod 600 /swapfile 

3. Make a fstab entry:
/swapfile none sw,loop 0 0	

4. Run as root to activate your file swap space:
swapon /swapfile
